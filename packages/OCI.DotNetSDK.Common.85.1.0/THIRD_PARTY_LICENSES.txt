For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of
the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives,

each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
License; and

within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable

(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited
to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components

Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates ("Microsoft") promise not to assert
any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or
as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime. 

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit
alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or
inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under
this promise will automatically terminate. 

This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or
enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other
intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those
expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by
Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise.
This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a
condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from
suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with
this promise.

Definitions:

"Covered Code" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as
made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime.

".NET Patents" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and
acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET
Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling
Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of
Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code
with third party code.

".NET Runtime" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of
the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common
Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional
functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API
documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include
Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant
with (a) and (b).

"Enabling Technology" means underlying or enabling technology that may be
used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework
or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications
that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes. 

.NET Core uses third-party libraries or other resources that may be
distributed under licenses different than the .NET Core software.

In the event that we accidentally failed to list a required notice, please

1.  Definitions

   The following definitions are for terms used in the context of this
   document.  Other terms, including "IESG", "ISOC", "IAB", and "RFC
   Editor" are defined in [RFC2028].

   a. "Contribution": any submission to the IETF intended by the
      Contributor for publication as all or part of an Internet-Draft or
      RFC (except for RFC Editor Contributions described in Section 4
      below) and any statement made within the context of an IETF
      activity.  Such statements include oral statements in IETF
      sessions as well as written and electronic communications, made at
      any time or place, that are addressed to:

      o the IETF plenary session,
      o any IETF working group or portion thereof,
      o any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session,
      o the IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG,
      o the IAB, or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB,
      o any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any
        working group or design team list, or any other list functioning
        under IETF auspices,
      o the RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function (except for RFC
        Editor Contributions, as described in Section 4 below).

      Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list, or other
      function, that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF
      activity, group, or function are not IETF Contributions in the
      context of this document.

   b. "Contributor": an individual submitting a Contribution.

   c. "Indirect Contributor": any person who has materially or
      substantially contributed to a Contribution without being
      personally involved in its submission to the IETF.

   d. "Copyright": the legal right granted to an author in a document or
      other work of authorship under applicable law.  A "copyright" is
      not equivalent to a "right to copy".  Rather a copyright
      encompasses all of the exclusive rights that an author has in a
      work, such as the rights to copy, publish, distribute and create
      derivative works of the work.  An author often cedes these rights
      to his or her employer or other parties as a condition of
      employment or compensation.

   e. "IETF": in the context of this document, the IETF includes all
      individuals who participate in meetings, working groups, mailing
      lists, functions, and other activities that are organized or
      initiated by ISOC, the IESG, or the IAB under the general
      designation of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), but
      solely to the extent of such participation.

   f. "IETF Documents": RFCs and Internet-Drafts that are used in the
      IETF Standards Process as defined in 1(g).  This is identical to
      the "IETF stream" defined in [RFC4844].

   g. "IETF Standards Process": the activities undertaken by the IETF in
      any of the settings described in 1(a) above.

   h. "IETF Trust": a trust established under the laws of the
      Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, in order to hold and administer
      intellectual property rights for the benefit of the IETF.

   i. "Internet-Draft": temporary documents used in the IETF Standards
      Process.  Internet-Drafts are posted on the IETF web site by the
      IETF Secretariat.  As noted in Section 2.2 of RFC 2026, Internet-
      Drafts have a nominal maximum lifetime of six months in the IETF
      Secretariat's public directory.

   j. "Legend Instructions": the standardized text that is maintained by
      the IETF Trust and is included in IETF Documents and the
      instructions and requirements for including that standardized text
      in IETF Documents.  The text and instructions are posted from time
      to time at http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.

   k. "RFC": the publication series used by the IETF among others.  RFCs
      are published by the RFC Editor.  Although RFCs may be superseded
      in whole or in part by subsequent RFCs, the text of an RFC is not
      altered once published in RFC form.  (See [RFC2026] Section 2.1.)

   l. "Reasonably and personally known": something an individual knows
      personally or, because of the job the individual holds, would
      reasonably be expected to know.  This wording is used to indicate
      that an organization cannot purposely keep an individual in the
      dark about certain information just to avoid the disclosure
      requirement.

   m. "Non-IETF documents": Internet-Drafts that are submitted to the
      RFC Editor independently of the IETF Standards Process.  (See
      Section 4.)

2.  Introduction

   In all matters of copyright and document procedures, the intent is to
   benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while
   respecting the legitimate rights of others.

   Under the laws of most countries and current international treaties
   (for example the "Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and
   Artistic Work" [Berne]), authors obtain numerous rights in the works
   they produce automatically upon producing them.  These rights include
   copyrights, moral rights, and other rights.  In many cases, if the
   author produces a work within the scope of his or her employment,
   most of those rights are usually assigned to the employer, either by
   operation of law or, in many cases, under contract.  (The Berne
   Convention names some rights as "inalienable", which means that the
   author retains them in all cases.)

   In order for Contributions to be used within the IETF Standards
   Process, including when they are published as Internet-Drafts or
   RFCs, certain limited rights must be granted to the IETF Trust, which
   then grants the necessary rights to the IETF.  In addition,
   Contributors must make representations to the IETF Trust and the IETF
   regarding their ability to grant these rights.

   Section 1 provides definitions used in these policies.  Sections 3
   and 4 of this document explain the rationale for these provisions.
   Sections 1, 2, 5, and 6 of this document are normative, the other
   sections are informative.  RFC 3979 (BCP 79) [RFC3979] deals with
   rights, including possible patent rights, in technologies developed
   or specified as part of the IETF Standards Process.  This document is
   not intended to address those issues.  This memo obsoletes RFCs 3978
   [RFC3978] and 4748 [RFC4748] and, with RFC 3979 (BCP 79) and
   [RFC5377], replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

   This document is not intended as legal advice.  Readers are advised
   to consult their own legal advisors if they would like a legal
   interpretation of their rights or the rights of the IETF Trust
   [RFC4371] in any Contributions they make.

2.1.  No Retroactive Effect

   This memo does not retroactively obtain additional rights from
   Contributions that predate the date that the IETF Trust announces the
   adoption of these procedures.

3.  Exposition of Why These Procedures Are the Way They Are

3.1.  Rights Granted in Contributions

   The IETF Trust and the IETF must obtain the right to publish an IETF
   Contribution as an RFC or an Internet-Draft from the Contributors.

   A primary objective of this policy is to obtain from the document
   authors only the non-exclusive rights that are needed to develop and
   publish IETF Documents and to use IETF Contributions in the IETF
   Standards Process and potentially elsewhere.

   The authors retain all other rights, but cannot withdraw the above
   rights from the IETF Trust and the IETF.

   It is important to note that under this document, Contributors are
   required to grant certain rights to the IETF Trust (see Section
   5.3.), which holds all IETF-related intellectual property on behalf
   of the IETF community.  The IETF Trust will, in turn, grant a
   sublicense of these rights to all IETF participants for use in the
   IETF Standards Process (see Section 5.4.).  This sublicense is
   necessary for the standards development work of the IETF to continue.
   In addition, the IETF Trust may grant certain other sublicenses of
   the rights that it is granted under this document.  In granting such
   other sublicenses, the IETF Trust will be guided and bound by
   documents such as [RFC5377].

3.2.  Rights to Use Contributions

   It is important that the IETF receive assurances from all
   Contributors that they have the authority to grant the IETF the
   rights that they claim to grant because, under the laws of most
   countries and applicable international treaties, copyright rights
   come into existence when a work of authorship is created (but see
   Section 3.5 below regarding public domain documents), and the IETF
   cannot make use of IETF Contributions if it does not have sufficient
   rights with respect to these copyright rights.  The IETF and its
   participants would run a greater risk of liability to the owners of
   these rights without this assurance.  To this end, the IETF asks
   Contributors to give the assurances in Section 5.6 below.  These
   assurances are requested, however, only to the extent of the
   Contributor's reasonable and personal knowledge.  (See Section 1(l).)

3.3.  Right to Produce Derivative Works

   The IETF needs to be able to evolve IETF Documents in response to
   experience gained in the deployment of the technologies described in
   such IETF Documents, to incorporate developments in research, and to
   react to changing conditions on the Internet and other IP networks.
   The IETF may also decide to permit others to develop derivative works
   based on Contributions.  In order to do this, the IETF must be able
   to produce derivatives of its documents; thus, the IETF must obtain
   the right from Contributors to produce derivative works.  Note that
   the right to produce translations is required before any Contribution
   can be published as an RFC, to ensure the widest possible
   distribution of the material in RFCs.  The right to produce
   derivative works, in addition to translations, is required for all
   IETF Standards Track documents and for most IETF non-Standards Track
   documents.  There are two exceptions to this requirement: documents
   describing proprietary technologies and documents that are
   republications of the work of other standards organizations.

   The right to produce derivative works must be granted in order for an
   IETF working group to accept a Contribution as a working group
   document or otherwise work on it.  For non-working group
   Contributions where the Contributor requests publication as a
   Standards Track RFC, the right to produce derivative works must be
   granted before the IESG will issue an IETF Last Call and, for most
   non-Standards Track, non-working group Contributions, before the IESG
   will consider the Internet-Draft for publication.  Occasionally a
   Contributor may not want to grant publication rights or the right to
   produce derivative works before finding out if a Contribution has
   been accepted for development in the IETF Standards Process.  In
   these cases, the Contributor may include a limitation on the right to
   make derivative works in the form specified in the Legend
   Instructions.  A working group can discuss the Contribution with the
   aim to decide if it should become a working group document, even
   though the right to produce derivative works or to publish the
   Contribution as an RFC has not yet been granted.  However, if the
   Contribution is accepted for development, the Contributor must
   resubmit the Contribution without the limitation notices before a
   working group can formally adopt the Contribution as a working group
   document.  The IETF Trust may establish different policies for
   granting sublicenses with respect to different types of Contributions
   and content within Contributions (such as executable code versus
   descriptive text or references to third-party materials).  The IETF
   Trust's policies concerning the granting of sublicenses to make
   derivative works will be guided by RFC [RFC5377].

   The IETF has historically encouraged organizations to publish details
   of their technologies, even when the technologies are proprietary,
   because understanding how existing technology is being used helps
   when developing new technology.  But organizations that publish
   information about proprietary technologies are frequently not willing
   to have the IETF produce revisions of the technologies and then
   possibly claim that the IETF version is the "new version" of the

organization's technology.  Organizations that feel this way can
   specify that a Contribution be published with the other rights
   granted under this document but may withhold the right to produce
   derivative works other than translations.

   In addition, IETF Documents frequently make normative references to
   standards or recommendations developed by other standards
   organizations.  Since the publications of some standards
   organizations are not public documents, it can be quite helpful to
   the IETF to republish, with the permission of the other standards
   organization, some of these documents as RFCs so that the IETF
   community can have open access to them to better understand what they
   are referring to.  In these cases, the RFCs can be published without
   the right for the IETF to produce derivative works.  In both of the
   above cases, in which the production of derivative works is excluded,
   the Contributor must include a special legend in the Contribution, as
   specified in the Legend Instructions, in order to notify IETF
   participants about this restriction.

3.4.  Rights to Use Trademarks

   Contributors may wish to seek trademark or service mark protection on
   any terms that are coined or used in their Contributions.  The IETF
   makes no judgment about the validity of any such trademark rights.
   However, the IETF requires each Contributor, under the licenses
   described in Section 5.3 below, to grant the IETF Trust a perpetual
   license to use any such trademarks or service marks solely in
   exercising rights to reproduce, publish, discuss, and modify the IETF
   Contribution.  This license does not authorize the IETF or others to
   use any trademark or service mark in connection with any product or
   service offering.

3.5.  Contributions Not Subject to Copyright

   Certain documents, including those produced by the U.S. government
   and those which are in the public domain, may not be protected by the
   same copyright and other legal rights as other documents.
   Nevertheless, we ask each Contributor to grant to the IETF the same
   rights he or she would grant, and to make the same representations,
   as though the IETF Contribution were protected by the same legal
   rights as other documents, and as though the Contributor could be
   able to grant these rights.  We ask for these grants and
   representations only to the extent that the Contribution may be
   protected.  We believe they are necessary to protect the ISOC, the
   IETF Trust, the IETF, the IETF Standards Process, and all IETF
   participants, and because the IETF does not have the resources or
   wherewithal to make any independent investigation as to the actual
   proprietary status of any document submitted to it.

3.6.  Copyright in RFCs

   As noted above, Contributors to the IETF (or their employers) retain
   ownership of the copyright in their Contributions.  This includes
   Internet-Drafts and all other Contributions made within the IETF
   Standards Process (e.g., via e-mail, oral comment, and otherwise).
   However, it is important that the IETF (through the IETF Trust) own
   the copyright in documents that are published as RFCs (other than
   Informational RFCs and RFCs that are submitted as RFC Editor
   Contributions).  Ownership of the copyright in an RFC does not
   diminish the Contributors' rights in their underlying contributions,
   but it does prevent anyone other than the IETF Trust (and its
   licensees) from republishing or modifying an RFC in RFC format.  In
   this respect, Contributors are treated the same as anybody else:
   though they may extract and republish their own Contributions without
   limitation, they may not do so in the RFC format used by the IETF.
   And while this principle (which is included in Section 5.9 below) may
   appear to be new to the IETF, it actually reflects historical
   practice and has been observed for many years through the inclusion
   of an ISOC or IETF Trust copyright notice on all RFC documents since
   the publication of RFC 2026.

4.  Non-IETF Documents

   This document only relates to Contributions made as part of the IETF
   Processes.  Other documents that are referred to as Internet-Drafts
   and RFCs may be submitted to and published by the RFC Editor
   independently of the IETF Standards Process.  Such documents are not
   covered by this document, unless the controlling entity for that
   document stream, as described in [RFC4844] chooses to apply these
   rules.  Non-IETF Contributions must be marked appropriately as
   described in the Legend Instructions.  See the RFC Editor web page
   for information about the policies concerning rights in RFC Editor
   Documents; for other document streams, the controlling entity must be
   contacted.  See Section 11 for a declaration from the IAB on this
   matter.

5.  Rights in Contributions

5.1.  General Policy

   By submission of a Contribution, each person actually submitting the
   Contribution and each named co-Contributor is deemed to have read and
   understood the rules and requirements set forth in this document.
   Each Contributor is deemed, by the act of submitting a Contribution,
   to enter into a legally-binding agreement to comply with the terms
   and conditions set forth in this document.

The Contributor is further deemed to have agreed that he/she has
   obtained the necessary permissions to enter into such an agreement
   from any party that the Contributor reasonably and personally knows
   may have rights in the Contribution, including, but not limited to,
   the Contributor's sponsor or employer.

   No further acknowledgment, signature, or other action is required to
   bind a Contributor to these terms and conditions.  The operation of
   the IETF and the work conducted by its many participants is dependent
   on such agreement by each Contributor, and each IETF participant
   expressly relies on the agreement of each Contributor to the terms
   and conditions set forth in this document.

5.2.  Confidentiality Obligations

   No information or document that is subject to any requirement of
   confidentiality or any restriction on its dissemination may be
   submitted as a Contribution or otherwise considered in any part of
   the IETF Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any
   confidentiality obligation with respect to any Contribution.  Each
   Contributor agrees that any statement in a Contribution, whether
   generated automatically or otherwise, that states or implies that the
   Contribution is confidential or subject to any privilege, can be
   disregarded for all purposes, and will be of no force or effect.

5.3.  Rights Granted by Contributors to the IETF Trust

   To the extent that a Contribution or any portion thereof is protected
   by copyright or other rights of authorship, the Contributor and each
   named co-Contributor grant a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, world-wide, sublicensable right and license to the IETF
   Trust under all such copyrights and other rights in the Contribution:

   a. to copy, publish, display, and distribute the Contribution, in
      whole or in part,

   b. to prepare translations of the Contribution into languages other
      than English, in whole or in part, and to copy, publish, display,
      and distribute such translations or portions thereof,

   c. to modify or prepare derivative works (in addition to
      translations) that are based on or incorporate all or part of the
      Contribution, and to copy, publish, display, and distribute such
      derivative works, or portions thereof unless explicitly disallowed
      in the notices contained in a Contribution (in the form specified
      by the Legend Instructions), and

   d. to reproduce any trademarks, service marks, or trade names which
      are included in the Contribution solely in connection with the
      reproduction, distribution, or publication of the Contribution and
      derivative works thereof as permitted by this Section 5.3,
      provided that when reproducing Contributions, trademark and
      service mark identifiers used in the Contribution, including TM
      and (R), will be preserved.

5.4.  Sublicenses by the IETF Trust

   The IETF Trust will sublicense the rights granted to it under Section
   5.3 to all IETF participants for use within the IETF Standards
   Process.  This license is expressly granted under a license agreement
   issued by the IETF Trust, which can be found at
   http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info.

   This license is expressly granted under a license agreement issued by
   the IETF Trust and must contain a pointer to the full IETF Trust
   agreement.

   In addition, the IETF Trust may grant additional sublicenses of the
   licenses granted to it hereunder.  In doing so, the IETF Trust will
   comply with the guidance provided under RFC 5377 [RFC5377].

5.5.  No Patent License

   The licenses granted in Section 5.3 shall not be deemed to grant any
   right under any patent, patent application, or other similar
   intellectual property right disclosed by the Contributor under BCP 79
   [RFC3979] or otherwise.

5.6.  Representations and Warranties

   With respect to each Contribution, each Contributor represents that,
   to the best of his or her knowledge and ability:

   a. The Contribution properly acknowledges all Contributors, including
      Indirect Contributors.

   b. No information in the Contribution is confidential, and the IETF,
      IETF Trust, ISOC, and its affiliated organizations may freely
      disclose any information in the Contribution.

   c. There are no limits to the Contributor's ability to make the
      grants, acknowledgments, and agreements herein that are reasonably
      and personally known to the Contributor.

   d. The Contributor has not intentionally included in the Contribution
      any material that is defamatory or untrue or which is illegal
      under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Contributor has
      his or her principal place of business or residence.

   e. All trademarks, trade names, service marks, and other proprietary
      names used in the Contribution that are reasonably and personally
      known to the Contributor are clearly designated as such where
      reasonable.

5.7.  No Duty to Publish

   The Contributor, and each named co-Contributor, acknowledges that the
   IETF has no duty to publish or otherwise use or disseminate any
   Contribution.  The IETF reserves the right to withdraw or cease using
   any Contribution that does not comply with the requirements of this
   Section 5.

5.8.  Trademarks

   Contributors who claim trademark rights in terms used in their IETF
   Contributions are requested to state specifically what conditions
   apply to implementers of the technology relative to the use of such
   trademarks.  Such statements should be submitted in the same way as
   is done for other intellectual property claims.  (See [RFC3979]
   Section 6.)

5.9.  Copyright in RFCs

   Subject to each Contributor's (or its sponsor's) ownership of its
   underlying Contributions as described in Section 5.6 (which ownership
   is qualified by the irrevocable licenses granted under Section 5.3),
   each Contributor hereby acknowledges that the copyright in any RFC in
   which such Contribution is included, other than an RFC that is an RFC
   Editor Contribution, shall be owned by the IETF Trust.  Such
   Contributor shall be deemed to assign to the IETF Trust such
   Contributor's copyright interest in the collective work constituting

   such RFC upon the submission of such RFC for publication, and
   acknowledges that a copyright notice acknowledging the IETF Trust's
   ownership of the copyright in such RFC will be included in the
   published RFC.

5.10.  Contributors' Retention of Rights

   Although Contributors provide specific rights to the IETF, it is not
   intended that this should deprive them of their right to exploit
   their Contributions.  To underscore this principle, the IETF Trust is

   directed to issue a license or assurance to Contributors, which
   confirms that they may each make use of their Contributions as
   published in an RFC in any way they wish, subject only to the
   restriction that no Contributor has the right to represent any
   document as an RFC, or equivalent of an RFC, if it is not a full and
   complete copy or translation of the published RFC.

6.  Legends, Notices and Other Standardized Text in IETF Documents

   The IETF requires that certain standardized text be reproduced
   verbatim in certain IETF Documents (including copies, derivative
   works, and translations of IETF Documents).  Some of this
   standardized text may be mandatory (e.g., copyright notices and
   disclaimers that must be included in all RFCs) and some may be
   optional (e.g., limitations on the right to make derivative works).
   The text itself, as well as the rules that explain when and how it
   must be used, is contained in the Legend Instructions.  The Legend
   Instructions may be updated from time to time, and the version of the
   standardized text that must be included in IETF Documents is that
   which was posted in the Legend Instructions on the date of
   publication.

   The IETF reserves the right to refuse to publish Contributions that
   do not include the legends and notices required by the Legend
   Instructions.

   It is important to note that each Contributor grants the IETF Trust
   rights pursuant to this document and the policies described herein.
   The legends and notices included in certain written Contributions
   such as Internet-Drafts do not themselves convey any rights.  They
   are simply included to inform the reader (whether or not part of the
   IETF) about certain legal rights and limitations associated with such
   documents.

   It is also important to note that additional copyright notices are
   not permitted in IETF Documents except in the case where such
   document is the product of a joint development effort between the
   IETF and another standards development organization or is a
   republication of the work of another standards development
   organization.  Such exceptions must be approved on an individual
   basis by the IAB.

7.  Security Considerations

   This memo relates to the IETF process, not any particular technology.
   There are security considerations when adopting any technology, but
   there are no known issues of security with IETF Contribution rights
   policies.

Written in 2018 by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna (vigna@acm.org)

To the extent possible under law, the author has dedicated all copyright
and related and neighboring rights to this software to the public domain
worldwide. This software is distributed without any warranty.

Creative Commons Zero v1.0

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES.
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.
CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS
MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF
THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work"). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish
those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative,
cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative,
cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their
 Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional
consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"),
to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms,
with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright
and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
include, but are not limited to, the following: the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
display, communicate, and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph
4(a), below; rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty,
and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes
of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's
heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment
of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum
extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition,
to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide,
(ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
(iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").
The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated
claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed
or otherwise affected by this document. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations
or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement,
or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or
not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work
or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document
and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Microsoft Patent Promise for .NET Libraries and Runtime Components

Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates ("Microsoft") promise not to assert
any .NET Patents against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale,
importing, or distributing Covered Code, as part of either a .NET Runtime or
as part of any application designed to run on a .NET Runtime.

If you file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in any claim in a lawsuit
alleging direct or contributory patent infringement by any Covered Code, or
inducement of patent infringement by any Covered Code, then your rights under
this promise will automatically terminate.

This promise is not an assurance that (i) any .NET Patents are valid or
enforceable, or (ii) Covered Code does not infringe patents or other
intellectual property rights of any third party. No rights except those
expressly stated in this promise are granted, waived, or received by
Microsoft, whether by implication, exhaustion, estoppel, or otherwise.
This is a personal promise directly from Microsoft to you, and you agree as a
condition of benefiting from it that no Microsoft rights are received from
suppliers, distributors, or otherwise from any other person in connection with
this promise.

Definitions:

"Covered Code" means those Microsoft .NET libraries and runtime components as
made available by Microsoft at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime.

".NET Patents" are those patent claims, both currently owned by Microsoft and
acquired in the future, that are necessarily infringed by Covered Code. .NET
Patents do not include any patent claims that are infringed by any Enabling
Technology, that are infringed only as a consequence of modification of
Covered Code, or that are infringed only by the combination of Covered Code
with third party code.

".NET Runtime" means any compliant implementation in software of (a) all of
the required parts of the mandatory provisions of Standard ECMA-335 – Common
Language Infrastructure (CLI); and (b) if implemented, any additional
functionality in Microsoft's .NET Framework, as described in Microsoft's API
documentation on its MSDN website. For example, .NET Runtimes include
Microsoft's .NET Framework and those portions of the Mono Project compliant
with (a) and (b).

"Enabling Technology" means underlying or enabling technology that may be
used, combined, or distributed in connection with Microsoft's .NET Framework
or other .NET Runtimes, such as hardware, operating systems, and applications
that run on .NET Framework or other .NET Runtimes.
